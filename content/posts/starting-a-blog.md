... again.

## What's this for?

There are a couple of things, like for example the Netflix story, that I get asked for over and over again, a couple of things I really want people to know about, plus I tend to rant about random things in Discord server, when no one wants to know about them.

This place is supposed to contain all that, and allow me to just send links whenever someone asks for something, and who knows, maybe someone will find this interesting.

I'll likely (read: perhaps) keep this post updated as that list changes.

## How?

I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) this time around, as that works pretty easy, there is a wide selection of themes, and it was very easy to set up on my NixOS server,  so I don't really have to care about the majority of stuff.

I'll end this here, as I don't really know what to put in this post, and it's mostly for testing anyways.
