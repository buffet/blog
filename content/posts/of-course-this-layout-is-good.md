Yes!, it is, and that's great!

Keyboard layouts are highly subjective.
Everyone has different hands, a differnet typing style, and likes or dislikes different things (e.g. "just tank the SFBs").
As a result of this everyone has different preferences when it comes to keyboard layouts.
Some people really like low SFB count, some people really hate using their pinkies, some people might have issues with their hands, forcing them to adapt a weird typing style.

A keyboard analyzer is a great way to to codify this.  
A scoring function is a great way to express what you like and dislike in layouts, assuming it's configured correctly.

If someone likes a layout the analyzer it was designed on is a *great* way to learn about the layout **because** it precisely expresses the subjective opinion of what the creator wants from their layout.
Looking at any other analyzer and from there drawing conclusions about the original goals is not optimal, as the analyzer represents the authors subjective opinion.

Taking this further, given a good enough generator, any user that can provide a scoring function that expresses their subjective opinion (which for most cases could be a simple config file they could tune) could generate their own layout for their own exact need, no matter what this might be, and no matter how other analyzers might rate it.
